        <h2>About Environmental Justice</h2>

        <p class='text'>Georgia is home to blah blah diversity, unique people blah blah, and Atlanta is home to us. As yellow jackets, we should look out for our fellow members of the Atlanta community.</p>

        <div class='image-container'>

                <img src='../res/imgs/about/food.png' />

        </div>

        <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>

        <p class='text'>The Environmental Justice movement was born out of the Civil Rights movement when Martin Luther King, Jr. lent his aid to the Sanitation Strike of 1968. The night before MLK’s assassination, he bravely told a 
            group of sanitation workers that “we’ve got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end.” Those fateful words would mark the beginning of a historic movement to ensure equity for all people in terms of environmental 
            protection. 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Environmental Justice movement, and though a lifetime of progress has been made to bring about environmental justice, we must remember that there is still a lot of work 
            left to do.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Why it matters?</h2>

        <p class='text'>Atlanta’s environmental justice should matter to Georgia Tech students for several reasons. Perhaps the most prominent reason is that we all live near the heart of Atlanta; whatever happens to the city, happens 
            to us. It is important that GT students care about their immediate surroundings. Looking at the graphs on this page dealing with tree cover, income, and environmental status, overlaps can 
            be easily seen. There is a connection between the wealth of a location in Atlanta, its average tree cover, and environmental status. The mission statement of Georgia Tech includes making a meaningful contribution to 
            society, including our immediate surroundings. The overlap of the surrounding graphs makes it clear that certain areas of Atlanta are underserved and suffering from bad environmental conditions. Students should care because 
            these people are suffering all around us. As students of Georgia Tech, it is our duty to do whatever we can to help those suffering.</p>
